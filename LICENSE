This is a compilation of the
- Port of some cryptography modules of ETH Oberon/Aos/A2 System (named "A2" in the following)
- X25519 implementation by Hirbod Behnam
- All other modules(GCM, TLS AEAD) writen by Anton Shelin

Nearly all parts of this subsystem belong to the ETH A2 System, exceptions are the files: 
"CommStreams", "Compat", "CompatDebug", "CompatTests", "FileStreams", "StdLogStream".

----

Oberon is the name of a modern integrated software environment. It is a single-user, 
multi-tasking system that runs on bare hardware or on top of a host operating system. 
Oberon is also the name of a programming language in the Pascal/Modula tradition. 
The Oberon project was launched in 1985 by Niklaus Wirth and JÃ¼rg Gutknecht.
